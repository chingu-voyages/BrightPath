# BrightPath Online Course Platform

**Created by the Go Getters**

## Project Vision Statement

During this six-week Chingu voyage, our team will design, develop, and launch BrightPath, a custom platform for online courses that will cover niche tech topics not currently addressed elsewhere.
All courses‚Äîincluding videos, readings, activities, and quizzes‚Äîwill be freely available to the public. Users can log in to access course content and track their progress.
Upon completing all required lessons and assessments for a given course, users will be issued a verified BrightPath certificate that can be shared on LinkedIn and other web platforms to demonstrate their achievement.
Our practical, project-based courses will help learners stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.
